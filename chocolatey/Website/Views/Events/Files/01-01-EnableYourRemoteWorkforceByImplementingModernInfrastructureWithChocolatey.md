*Deploying software to remote desktop and endpoint devices is not always easy, especially in highly regulated and locked down environments. This can be even more challenging if your IT team is overworked, and you need to ensure your users are productive with no vulnerabilities.*

After the first weeks of remote working, organizations are beginning to see the cracks in their remote working approaches and recognize that they need a more scalable, automated, and secure solution.

When faced with unplanned events or special projects, organizations can be required to set-up remote workers with very little notice. Many IT teams are not equipped to add and secure remote workers in such short timeframes.

Chocolatey provides a unique approach to managing end-user software that can also be combined with existing solutions.
