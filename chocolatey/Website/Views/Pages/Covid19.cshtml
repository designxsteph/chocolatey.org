                            As part of the current pandemic, Chocolatey Software is responding in a number of ways. One of those ways is to enable organizations like yours to implement more modern infrastructure that better supports a remote workforce.
                            Another thing we've done in response to this time is prepared a full environment based on our Chocolatey infrastructure architecture recommendations.
