---
"We manage a broad range of application requirements across academic disciplines summarised by approximately 500 applications on 7000 managed endpoints. Chocolatey is quickly becoming an indispensable piece of our configuration management toolset for end-user devices.

We have reduced our packaging overheads and complexity for many applications through the internalisation of community packages. This has also allowed us to update third party apps more rapidly to improve levels of security and compliance.

Chocolatey has also been instrumental in our focus on increased automation/orchestration and is a key tool used in our containerisation journey with Docker."
