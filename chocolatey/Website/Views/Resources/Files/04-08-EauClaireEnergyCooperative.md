"Chocolatey has been a great addition to our IT toolset. It has streamlined our workstation deployment down to a fraction of the time it used to take. We've also leveraged the tools to create our own custom packages for in house software. Keeping our workstations up to date is also automated and working smoothly. We have visibility into what products are installed and updated very easily. This greatly enhances our security by not having outdated software packages on the network. I highly recommend Chocolatey to my colleagues when they ask how we are accomplishing these tasks."
