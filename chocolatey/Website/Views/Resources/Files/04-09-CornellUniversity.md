---
"Chocolatey has greatly simplified package management on Windows computers via its integration with Puppet configuration management software. This configuration has allowed us to leverage similar skillsets in configuration management across Windows and Linux. The command line interface to package management also makes it easy to use several remote tools to check on, install, and uninstall packages in an ad hoc manner on Windows.

The Chocolatey business version helps us by making it dead simple to import packages for use from the gallery to our internal secure repository."
