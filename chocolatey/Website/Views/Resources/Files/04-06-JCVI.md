"In the SMB market we just don't have the resources to dedicate an entire FTE to managing a complex configuration management tool. As a result, these types of monumental products tend to fail monumentally. Chocolatey is allowing us to leverage modular DevOps practices in a much more economical way. It's well worth investing in Chocolatey for Business, which provides the extra tooling we need to realize our DevOps goals faster."
