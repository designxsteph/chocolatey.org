"Chocolatey has gone from a convenience to a necessity. It has helped us automate third party software updates, which has improved end user experiences and our on-site security. It has saved time by reducing the volume of calls to our help desk for simple issues like Flash Player updates, so we can focus on other issues. It's integration with Chef has allowed us to automate software installation and deployment. Gone are the days when we would provision and deploy a PC with an outdated version of Chrome. With Chef and Chocolatey we deploy updated software every time a PC is provisioned. Chocolatey has helped us wrangle all of the applications we use into one manageable and automation friendly interface."
